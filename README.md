# Fastest way around FIU
This project consists of a map GUI that uses an implication of Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path between two buildings in the FIU MMC campus. Note that this project can be repurposed for other sets of buildings if the position and paths between the buildings are known.

## How to initiate the UI?
To initiate the UI, run the file `Fastest way around FIU.jar`

## How to see the shortest path between two buildings?
To see the shortest path, click on any two blue dots. The black line that appears is the shortest path.

## How to deselect selected buildings?
You can deselect a point by clicking on the selected point.

## When two buildings are already selected, What happens when you click on an unselected point?
When two points are selected, if a point that isn't selected gets clicked, the shortest path between the first point selected and the newly selected point gets shown.
